# Changelog

What changed in each release, newest first. `make ship VERSION=x.y.z` takes
the section headed `## x.y.z` as that release's notes: it is shown on the
GitHub release and in the update window of every installed copy. A version
with no section ships with no notes.

Write for the person who runs Evlat, not for the code: what they will notice.

## 0.1.3

- **Go to session** now opens the session's own tab in Bateri, Metalterm,
  Warp and iTerm, and the session itself in the Claude desktop app, instead
  of only bringing the app forward.
- iTerm sessions are now found: their card shows **Go to session** instead
  of saying no terminal was found.
- Terminal and Ghostty still come forward as before; picking their tab would
  need a macOS permission Evlat does not ask for.
